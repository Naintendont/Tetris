# Tetris
Made on Ubuntu, this is a remake of tetris with an added bomb feature that clears the screen if the bomb is same color as the block it falls on

the commands needed to run this in the ubuntu terminal are:
g++ -c tetris.cpp
g++ tetris.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio
./sfml-app
